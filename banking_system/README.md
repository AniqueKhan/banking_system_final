"AI-Powered Banking Application: Merging Python, Django, and Machine Learning"

The journey of fusing Machine Learning with Python Development has been a longstanding goal of mine, and today, I'm excited to share my accomplishment!

I'm thrilled to present my newest full stack application, meticulously crafted with Python and Django for the backend, while the frontend is elegantly designed using Bootstrap.

üè¶ This project introduces a comprehensive Banking System application, equipped with a range of features:
1) Seamless account opening process, with users providing key insights such as gender, income, and education.
2) Effortless management of account balances.
3) Stay updated through real-time notifications concerning loan applications and request statuses‚Äîboth displayed on the website and delivered via email.

...and much more!

But what truly elevates this project is the infusion of machine learning. Our sophisticated model takes center stage when users seek loans. Through intricate analysis, we gauge a user's ability to comfortably repay the loan within the stipulated time frame. The model's verdict determines loan approval, safeguarding financial stability.

To train our model, we harnessed a meticulously curated dataset from Kaggle.com. After rigorous evaluation, Linear Regression emerged triumphant among a formidable lineup of contenders.

Here's a glimpse into the model evaluation process:

Algorithm : Accuracy
- Logistic Regression: 78.86%
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC): 78.05%
- Decision Tree Classifier: 69.92%
- Random Forest Classifier: 76.42%
- Gradient Boosting Classifier: 76.42%
- Custom Logistic Regression: 78.86%
- Custom SVC: 78.86%
- Custom Random Forest Classifier: 78.86%

After thorough assessment, I confidently selected Linear Regression as the optimal choice.
